# Building a CPU From Scratch
This is my personal implementation of the CPU in the fabulous online course From NAND to Tetris. Instead of using the hardware simulator and HDL provided by the professors, I decide to use Verilog and Vivado to implement my designs. And finally I plan to run the CPU on a Zynq 7000 evaluation board (only using the FPGA). I will record the difficulties and problems along the way, hoping to provide a hand-on tutorial for those who wants to implement a CPU on an actual hardware.
